      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, My name is Chris Bush.  I am very excited to join this class.  I know it will be a lot of hard work; but will change my future.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Glenview, IL, a near-north suburb of Chicago. I moved to Charlotte in 2007.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have two high school children, so my hobby list isn't very impressive. I love to cook and experiment with recipes. 
          I am addicted to talk radio and podcasts of 2 taboo subjects: Religion and Politics. I also enjoy landscaping and fantasy baseball.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is getting back into IT after a long layoff. I enjoy working on a team instead of being an individual contributor.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have lived in the same house in south Charlotte since moving here in 2007.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In my eyes, Web Developers are cool. It just seems like the ideal job because you can develop something fairly quickly 
          that can be seen and shared with others, and also be constantly modified to make it even better. Also, I would like to be
          able to work on side projects to volunteer my services to help develop websites for non-profit organizations.</p>
